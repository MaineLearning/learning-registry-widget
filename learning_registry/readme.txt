This plugin is built for people keen to display content from a learning registry (node) on their WordPress site.

== Description ==
This plugin was developed for the Politics InSpires (http://politicsinspires.org) project at the University of Oxford.

The project was JISC Funded, and sits as part of "Open Spires" (ttp://openspires.oucs.ox.ac.uk/). Open Spires  is a project led by the Learning Technologies Group, Oxford University Computing Services, University of Oxford.

In terms of long term support, the code is being maintained by the Open Attribute team (http://openattribute.com).

This plugin allows you to search Flickr for various content (all licensed in some form) and then for you to bring that content into WordPress and attribute it correctly.

A simpler sister plug in is available which searches for just CC-BY.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all files to the `/wp-content/plugins/learning-registry/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
